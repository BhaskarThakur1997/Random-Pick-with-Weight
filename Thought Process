Binary Search
Since every integer is weighted, we need to get the total sum before we pick a point
The total sum does not exceed the integer max value, so we can use a int to store the sum
After creating accumulated sum array, we generate a random point, r, between [0, sum) and perform binary search on this accumulated array
Time complexity O(n)
Space complexity O(n)

TreeMap
We can leverage the treemap built-in treemap to do similar thing as above
Save the accumulated sum and its index, we can retrieve the index latter
Time complexity O(n)
Space complexity O(n)
